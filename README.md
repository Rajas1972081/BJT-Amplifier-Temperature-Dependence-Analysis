# BJT-Amplifier-Temperature-Dependence-Analysis
This project examined how temperature variations affect the performance of a common-emitter BJT amplifier. The objective was to quantify changes in gain, distortion, and waveform stability across a wide temperature range.

## Project Overview
This project examined how temperature variations affect the performance of a common-emitter BJT amplifier. The objective was to quantify changes in gain, distortion, and waveform stability across a wide temperature range.

## Methodology
- Designed and simulated a BJT amplifier using a BC547C transistor.
- Conducted temperature sweeps from −10 °C to 110 °C.
- Compared simulated data with real circuit measurements.

## Oscilloscope Usage
Oscilloscope measurements were central to the project:
- Captured amplifier output waveforms under different temperature conditions.
- Measured gain changes, distortion, and clipping thresholds.
- Verified theoretical predictions by observing real-time waveform variations.

## Outcomes
- Gain remained ~50 under low-temperature, low-distortion conditions.
- High-temperature operation led to waveform clipping and reduced performance.
- Findings highlighted the role of VBE drift, β variation, and leakage current in thermal sensitivity.
